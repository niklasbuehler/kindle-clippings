# mdkindle

A Python script to convert your Kindle clippings into markdown.
Comes with a handy little shell script to directly convert your clippings into a bunch of webpages.

## Usage

1. Save your Kindle clippings as `clippings.txt` into this folder.
2. Run `sudo python mdkindle.py` for the markdown files or `sudo ./kindle2html.sh` for the html version.
3. Find the result in the `notes` folder.

You can just dig into the code and change the formatting pretty easily.

## Credits

I've taken the basic outline from a script found [here](https://github.com/mammuth/kindle-clippings).
